#### goal
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

#### challenges
so i have spent over 20 hours on this homework and it still doesnt work. I know what i have to do but am unable to figure out how. I need to be pushing the data into the empty employeeNew array and then push the information into generateHtml. And I need to also use the constructor functions somehow. Overall, this homework was overwhelming and simply more than one weeks of work. I would need two more weeks to get it running properly. 

#### how it runs
currently the inquirer function works and you are able to add a intern or engineer but youll notice most of the data come back undefined. it doesnt have working tests right now. i tried.
